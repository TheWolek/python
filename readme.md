If you are working in VS code, you can install these extensions for python developing

## Getting Started with VS Code

If you are using VS Code, you should install these extensions:

* Python from microsoft
* Code Runner by Jun Han

Also you should set up a shortcut for python file execution in terminal
To do that navigate to file > preferencec > keyboard shortcuts
type in the search bar 'Python: run python file in terminal'
double click on one of results and bind this for e.g. 'ctrl+.'

## Otherwise, you can use PyCharm

Shortcut to run a file is Ctrl+Shift+F10

## I think we are ready to code. Have fun!
